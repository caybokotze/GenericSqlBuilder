# Generic Sql Builder
## What is it?

Great question. Generic Sql Builder is a sql generation tool designed in a fluent way to allow devs to create sql queries quickly, but as bare metal as possible. I like to use this library to quickly write sql queries or even more advanced statements along with dapper, which is my ORM of choice.

I made this to serve the purpose of making native sql code a little bit easier to maintain over time and sligly more dynamic without sacrificing granular control over your queries.
